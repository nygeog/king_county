King County NETS
===========
This project takes place in King County, Washington. The data involved is cardiovascular outcome data (which I don't have access to) and NETS business data (what is the time frame? range? Could reference NETS data years).





Tasks
=====

1. Gina would like the population and land area and business counts for all King County census tracts, not just the ones UW provided data on

tractid, population, land_area, business counts, 5kmbufpop, 5km land area 5km business counts


2. Instead of ZCTA for King County, Gina is interested in characterizing a 5km buffer from the census tract centroid.
